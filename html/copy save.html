            Fortnite provides options to customize controller sensitivity and
            aim assist settings. Experiment with different sensitivity settings
            to find what works best for you. Generally, a lower sensitivity can
            help with precision aiming, while a higher sensitivity allows for
            quicker movements. Adjust the aim assist strength based on your
            preference.

            <p class="text-muted">
              Fortnite's Creative mode offers a variety of aim training maps and
              scenarios created by the community. Spend time in these maps to
              practice your aim and develop muscle memory. Look for maps
              specifically designed to improve aim or aim training courses that
              simulate real in-game scenarios.

          <h3 class="fw-light">Use the training range</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Fortnite's training range allows you to practice shooting at targets
            with different weapons. Use this mode to familiarize yourself with
            the mechanics of different guns, work on your tracking, and refine
            your aim.

            <h3 class="fw-light">Master different aiming techniques</h3>
            <p class="text-muted">
              There are two primary aiming techniques used in Fortnite: tracking
              and flick shots. Tracking involves smoothly following your
              target's movements, while flick shots require quickly snapping
              your aim to hit a target. Practice both techniques to become
              proficient in various situations.

            <h3 class="fw-light">Utilize aim assist</h3>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Fortnite's aim assist feature helps console players by subtly
              tracking targets. It's important to understand how aim assist
              functions and learn to use it effectively. Remember, aim assist
              should be seen as an aid, not a crutch. Relying solely on aim
              assist may limit your gcolumnth as a player.

            <h3 class="fw-light">Analyze gameplay and learn from others</h3>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Watch replays of your gameplay or study skilled Fortnite players
              on platforms like Twitch or YouTube. Observe their aiming
              techniques, movement, and decision-making. Pay attention to how
              they adjust their aim during engagements and try to incorporate
              those strategies into your own gameplay.

            <h3 class="fw-light">Play with purpose</h3>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Rather than mindlessly playing, focus on specific aspects of your
              aiming that need improvement. Set goals for each session and
              actively work towards them. For example, you could focus on
              improving shotgun accuracy or long-range sniping.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="d-flex flex-column">
            <h3 class="fw-light">Play regularly</h3>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Consistency is key to improving your aim. Set aside dedicated time
              each day or week to practice your aim. Regular practice will help
              build muscle memory and improve your reflexes.
